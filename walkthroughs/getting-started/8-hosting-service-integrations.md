GitLens provides integrations with many Git hosting services, including GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab self-managed, Gitea, Gerrit, Google Source, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server, Azure DevOps and custom servers.

All Git host integrations provide issue and pull request auto-linking, while rich integrations (e.g. GitHub & GitLab) provide more detailed hover information for auto-linked issues and pull requests, pull requests associated with branches and commits, and avatars.
